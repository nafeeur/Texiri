## Inspiration 
The inspiration behind this project was to create an AI assistant that can be accessed through text messages and can be used both online and offline.

## What it does 
Texiri is a Python-based application that provides answers to various user search inquiries (googling), solves computational problems (from basic algebra to calculus), translates texts from and to different languages, fetches daily weather/news from myriad categories, and downloads high-quality images from the web. All these functionalities can be accomplished just by sending text messages and thus do not require any WiFi or Cellular Data. Texiri uses Twilio as its backend and various other APIs such as Wolfram-Alpha API, Wikipedia API, and GoogleTranslate API to fuel its functionalities.

## Challenges
As this was the first time I was using Twilio, I faced some minor challenges in the beginning when trying to send a text message from the Twilio client. However, I was able to resolve the issues quickly by following the Twilio documentation.

## What I learned
By completing this project, I learned how to work with Twilio, various REST APIs, ngrok, and Flask.

## What's next for Texiri
In the future, I plan to add new features to Texiri such as new query commands, a text-based game, and voice support
