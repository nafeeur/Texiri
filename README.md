## Inspiration 🔥 
The idea behind the project was to create an AI Assistant that can be accessed through text messages and can be used both Online/Offline.

## What it does ⚙️
The "application" can provide answer to various user search inquiries (googling), solve computational problems (from basic algebra to calculus), translate texts from and to different languages, fetch daily news/weather-report from myriad of categories and download high quality wallpapers and images from the web. All these can be accomplished just by sending text messages. 

## How we built it 🛠️
The project is written in Python and uses Twilio as its backend. In addition, it uses various other APIs to fuel the functionalities. 

## Challenges we ran into ⚠️
Since this was my first time using Twilio, I did face some minor challenges at the beginning when trying to send a text message from the Twilio client. However, I was able to resolve it shortly by following the Twilio docs.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🎉
Being able to finish the project.

## What we learned 📖
By completing this project, I was able to learn how to work with Twilio, various REST-APIs, ngrok and flask.

## What's next for Texiri 🤔
Adding new features such as new query commands, a text based game and voice support.
