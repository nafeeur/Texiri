## Inspiration üî• 
The idea behind the project was to create an AI Assistant that can be accessed through text messages and can be used both Online/Offline.

## What it does ‚öôÔ∏è
The "Application" can provide answers through SMS to various user search inquiries (googling), solve  computational problems (from basic algebra to calculus), translate texts from and to different languages, fetch daily weather/news from myriad of categories and download high quality images from the web. All these can be accomplished just by sending text messages and thus does not require any WiFi or Cellular Data. The project is written in Python and uses Twilio as its backend. In addition, it uses various other APIs to fuel the functionalities such as Wolfram-Alpha API, Wikipedia API and GoogleTranslate API.

## Challenges I ran into ‚ö†Ô∏è
Since this was my first time using Twilio, I did face some minor challenges at the beginning when trying to send a text message from the Twilio client. However, I was able to resolve it shortly by following the Twilio docs.

## What I learned üìñ
By completing this project, I was able to learn how to work with Twilio, various REST-APIs, ngrok and flask.

## What's next for Texiri ü§î
Adding new features such as new query commands, a text based game and voice support.
